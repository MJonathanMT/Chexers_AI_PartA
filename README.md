# AI_projA

First part of the project for Artificial Intelligence subject in the University of Melbourne.

## Overview

Utilized Greedy Search as the game playing agent for a single-player game. Aim of the project was to design an algorithm to have all the player's pieces exit the game board in the least amount of steps as possible.

## Main learnings

### Greedy Search

- Worked with a teammate (MJonathanMT) to design a Greedy algorithm for our game-playing agent. End result was a complete solution, and almost optimal (our algorithm takes 0 - 2 steps more than optimal solutions).
- The algorithm was later used as a base for Part B of this project. (Refer to AI_GamePlayingAgent_PartB in yho4's repository).

### Algorithms and data structures

- Revised on and utilized data structures such as **lists**, **dictionaries**, **tuples** to create the overall game-playing algorithm.
